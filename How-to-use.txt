The usage is very simple.
First clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/Entware-ng/Entware-ng.git
and cd to Entware-ng directory
    cd Entware-ng
Second get the feeds:
    ./scripts/feeds update
    ./scripts/feeds install -a
Third copy config for your arch from configs folder:
    cp -f ./configs/mipselsf.config .config
Fourth - run make:
    make
================================
You can run make in several steps:

make tools/install
make toolchain/install
make target/compile
make package/compile

You can use several simultaneous jobs (-jN) and verbose output. For example (V=s)

make -j5 package/compile V=s
